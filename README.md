#Description

This is the last project for udacity fullstack nanodegree
In this project, you need to use lightsail, a part of amazon web service(AWS) to create a virtual machine and prepare it to host your application
like the item catalog that you have created before. Since the project requirement does not tell me to do that you will only be welcomed with 
apache default page upon accessing the ip address

#Setup
 1.Make an AWS account
side notes: even though the udacity instruction is simple but sigining up for an AWS has become harder and more complicated in the recent time
but i asure that after creating an account everything will work properly
 2.Using [lightsail](lghtsail.aws.amazon.com)
